I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.vt.edu/">Virginia Tech</a>, focusing on <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">Broadband Internet Policy</span>, working with <a href="https://shaddih.com/">Professor Dr. Shaddi Hasan</a>. My research interests include <a href="https://www.cs.vt.edu/research/areas/networks.html">Computer Networks</a>, <a href="https://ictd.org/">Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICTD)</a>, <a href="https://hci.stanford.edu/">HCI</a>, and Mobile Network Architecture. My work lies at the intersection of <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">internet measurement</span>, developing techniques for evaluating <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">Quality of Experience (QoE)</span>, and leveraging machine learning to address real-world challenges faced by internet service providers and regulatory agencies.

My expertise combines a solid foundation in <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">statistical methodologies</span> with practical applications of machine learning. I use these tools to analyze complex datasets, investigate broadband accessibility, and assess network performance, contributing to efforts aimed at closing the digital divide. My recent research, which was presented at <a href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2024/">ACM IMC 2024</a>, focuses on enhancing the <a href="https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/">U.S. National Broadband Map</a> by identifying and addressing discrepancies in service availability claims. This involves developing automated systems to detect low-quality service availability claims by ISPs and uncovering actionable insights to promote <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">broadband equity</span>.

Beyond technical research, I actively engage in <a href="https://www.vt.edu/academics/interdisciplinary.html">interdisciplinary collaborations</a> to tackle societal challenges such as improving broadband access, understanding user experiences in cellular networks, and supporting data-driven policymaking. My prior experience as a Network Planner has provided me with practical insights into broadband infrastructure, which I integrate into my academic work to bridge the gap between research and real-world applications.

Through my work, I aim to develop tools and analytics that enhance decision-making, foster equitable broadband deployment, and inform policies that advance <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">digital equity</span> in the internet and telecommunications sector.
