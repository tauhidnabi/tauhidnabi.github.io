I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.vt.edu/">Virginia Tech</a>, mentored by <a href="https://shaddih.com/">Professor Dr. Shaddi Hasan</a>. My research focuses on <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">Broadband Internet Policy</span> and <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">Internet Data Analytics</span>, with a passion for solving real-world challenges in <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">Computer Networks</span> and <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICTD)</span>. I work at the crossroads of <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">Internet Measurement</span>, improving <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">Quality of Experience (QoE)</span>, and using machine learning to help Internet Service Providers and regulators enhance network performance and accessibility.

My expertise combines a solid understanding of <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">Statistical methodologies</span> with practical applications of <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">Machine Learning</span>. I use these tools to analyze complex datasets, investigate broadband accessibility, and assess network performance, contributing to efforts aimed at closing the digital divide. My recent research, which was presented at <a href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2024/">ACM IMC 2024</a>, focuses on enhancing the <a href="https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/">U.S. National Broadband Map</a> by identifying and addressing discrepancies in service availability claims. This involves developing automated systems to detect low-quality service availability claims by ISPs and uncovering actionable insights to promote <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">Broadband Equity</span>.

I am focused on addressing societal challenges such as improving broadband access, enhancing the quality of experiences in cellular networks, and supporting data-driven policymaking. My prior experience as a <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">Network Planner</span> has provided me with valuable practical insights into broadband infrastructure, which I integrate into my academic work to bridge the gap between research and real-world applications.

Through my work, I aim to develop tools and analytics that enhance decision-making, foster equitable broadband deployment, and inform policies that advance <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">Digital Equity</span> in the Internet and telecommunications sector.


<span style="font-size:14px;color: red;"><b>I am actively seeking summer internships for 2026 (with the possibility of extending into Fall 2026) in the fields of Internet Measurement and Data Science. I am eager to apply my skills, tackle industry challenges, and continue learning. If you're interested in collaborating, feel free to email me at</b></span> [tauhid.eecs@gmail.com](mailto:tauhid.eecs@gmail.com).
